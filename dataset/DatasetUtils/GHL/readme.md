This is shit, where are the dataset with the anomalies ???????????????????????

In the GHL model we introduced four types of cyber attack to the normal process logic:
• unauthorized change of max RT level,
• unauthorized change of max HT temperature,
• unauthorized change of pump frequency,
• unauthorized change of system relaxing time value.
In the current paper we only present the results for fitting and testing the LSTM for anomalies generated by the first type of attack to the max-RT-level set point. By changing the time of attack and the value of the hacked max-RT-level, we generated many anomalous data sets used for fault detection. To train the LSTM we used only a data set with normal behavior.

# No anomalies labeled

Added own anomaly as a mean increase of the RT_level (value-3)
